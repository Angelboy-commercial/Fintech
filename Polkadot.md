# On the **Dot**

## What is *Polkadot*?
Polkadot is one of the pioneer blockchains of the new web 3.0. Polkadot is one of a core handful of what

are called Layer 1 blockchains. This means that the protocol serves as a foundation for other protocols 

to build on top of it. Polkadot was founded by Gavin Woods, who is also one of the co-founders of ethereum.

Gavin at the head, Robert Habermeier and Peter Czaban are also co-founders. Polkadot was created in 2016 

and launched a first round Initial Coin Offering (ICO) that raised 140 million dollars in 2017. The reason

for Polkadot being created was difference in opinion within leaders of Ethereum over how to solve the

trilemma that plagues crypto. The blockchain trilemma is the term used to describe the issue 

involving scalabilty, decentralization and security. By focusing on any of the two creates big weaknesses

in the last. The way Gavin Wood and Polkadot chose to solve this was by creating a protocol 'relay' chain.

Polkadot is what is referred to as a heterogenous protocol, meaning different blockchains connect to 

the relay chain and share security and consensus. Polkadot will have 100 parachains

(blockchains that connect to relay chian) who all compete for the slots in auctions. During these auctions 

blockchains will have to ask Dot (polkadot native token) holders to lend their tokens to the team in order 

to bid for a spot in auctions. What happens is if the blockchain you lend to wins an auction spot? The DOT you

lent is now locked to help secure the relay chain for 2 years(duration of the slot). If the protocol you lent to

loses, they may keep the DOT temperarily in order to compete in another upcoming auction. Otherwise, is returned back

to it's rightful owner.

### Let's get to Business
If you had to put a pinpoint on the main commerce issue that polkadot is trying to solve it would be...

all of them. See, polkadot itself is not a protocol that focuses on a partiular solution but more a house 

chain that hosts 100 parachains who generally all service a niche solution. Any blockchain can attmept to 

connect to the Polkadot relay chain, even it's 'competitors' via bridges. Therefore, the market is really 

anyone using cryptocurrency/blockchain technology. More than likely you will have either interacted 

directly with a parachain or indirectly through bridging between blockchains. On top of the fact that new 

and different parachains will be intrigated throughout the year. 







#### I'm the boss?(Governance)
Governance in very short summary is the manner in which a blockchain is secured and votes on new implementations to the protocol. 

**Security**
Polkadot has one of the most complex goverence systems in the entire blockchains ecosystems and has many roles within it's security.

Starting from the bottom of the food chain their are the nominators everyday DOT holders who stake(essentially lend). Collators can be 

compared to middle men, their role is to shard transactions and make it easier for validators. The role of validator is to confirm the

transactions of the collators and to secure the network through consensus with other validators. Validators are selected by the Polkadot

community because they need Dot holder to nominate them via staking. Lastly, Fishermen are the undercover agents of the ecosystem.

They report bad behavior/actors on the parachain to Validators. Fishermen can be played by a variety of roles in the ecosystem including

collators, hence the undercover agent anaolgy.



**Upgrades**
Polkadot has a very interesting rollout of the relay chain. How the chain operates in the beginning is

very different from what it will look like in its final form. In the beginng the chain will operate off 

of a proof of Authority. The Web3 Foundation(creators of Polkadot) will have a sudo key which will allow

them to make emergency upgrades and anything else needed to maintain the network. After the initial phase,

each step after will make the Web3 Foundation's sudo key less important. Next, a worthy set of validators 

are nominated. Eventually, what is known as the (first)Council members will be selected by DOT holders. These

are elected officials that have the power to stop potentially harmful upgrades Dot holders have voted in favor

of. A technical committee is also estbalished of teams who work on the protocol. They colaborate with the 

Council members in cases of emergency and other decisions that may need swift implemention. The final step 

is when the governce is in full operation and DOT holders can vote on an upgrade to remove the Web3 Foundation's

sudo key. From this point in the future of the network is 100% in the hands of those who use it, how it should

be. This was a very short and simple summary for a long, complex processes that has been rolling out over the 

course of years and will continue to!
