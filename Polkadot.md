# On the **Dot**

# What is *Polkadot*?
Polkadot is one of the pioneer blockchains of the new web 3.0. Polkadot is one of a core handful of what

are called Layer 1 blockchains. This means that the protocol serves as a foundation for other protocols 

to build on top of it. Polkadot was founded by Gavin Woods, who is also one of the co-founders of ethereum.

Gavin at the head, Robert Habermeier and Peter Czaban are also co-founders. Polkadot was created in 2016 

and launched a first round Initial Coin Offering (ICO) that raised 140 million dollars in 2017. The reason

for Polkadot being created was difference in opinion within leaders of Ethereum over how to solve the

trilemma that plagues crypto. The blockchain trilemma is the term used to describe the issue 

involving scalabilty, decentralization and security. By focusing on any of the two creates big weaknesses

in the last. The way Gavin Wood and Polkadot chose to solve this was by creating a protocol 'relay' chain.

Polkadot is what is referred to as a heterogenous protocol, meaning different blockchains connect to 

the relay chain and share security and consensus. Polkadot will have 100 parachains

(blockchains that connect to relay chian) who all compete for the slots in auctions. During these auctions 

blockchains will have to ask Dot (polkadot native token) holders to lend their tokens to the team in order 

to bid for a spot in auctions. What happens is if the blockchain you lend to wins an auction spot? The DOT you

lent is now locked to help secure the relay chain for 2 years(duration of the slot). If the protocol you lent to

loses, they may keep the DOT temperarily in order to compete in another upcoming auction. Otherwise, is returned back

to it's rightful owner.

# Let's get to Business
If you had to put a pinpoint on the main commerce issue that polkadot is trying to solve it would be...

all of them. See, polkadot itself is not a protocol that focuses on a partiular solution but more a house 

chain that hosts 100 parachains who generally all service a niche solution. Any blockchain can attmept to 

connect to the Polkadot relay chain, even it's 'competitors' via bridges. Therefore, the market is really 

anyone using cryptocurrency/blockchain technology. More than likely you will have either interacted 

directly with a parachain or indirectly through bridging between blockchains. On top of the fact that new 

and different parachains will be intrigated throughout the year.

# I'm the boss?(Governance)
Governance in very short summary is the manner in which a blockchain is secured and votes on new implementations to the protocol. 

**Security**

Polkadot has one of the most complex goverence systems in the entire blockchains ecosystems and has many roles within it's security.

Starting from the bottom of the food chain their are the nominators everyday DOT holders who stake(essentially lend). Collators can be 

compared to middle men, their role is to shard transactions and make it easier for validators. The role of validator is to confirm the

transactions of the collators and to secure the network through consensus with other validators. Validators are selected by the Polkadot

community because they need Dot holder to nominate them via staking. Lastly, Fishermen are the undercover agents of the ecosystem.

They report bad behavior/actors on the parachain to Validators. Fishermen can be played by a variety of roles in the ecosystem including

collators, hence the undercover agent anaolgy.





**Upgrades**

Polkadot has a very interesting rollout of the relay chain. How the chain operates in the beginning is

very different from what it will look like in its final form. In the beginng the chain will operate off 

of a proof of Authority. The Web3 Foundation(creators of Polkadot) will have a sudo key which will allow

them to make emergency upgrades and anything else needed to maintain the network. After the initial phase,

each step after will make the Web3 Foundation's sudo key less important. Next, a worthy set of validators 

are nominated. Eventually, what is known as the (first)Council members will be selected by DOT holders. These

are elected officials that have the power to stop potentially harmful upgrades Dot holders have voted in favor

of. A technical committee is also estbalished of teams who work on the protocol. They colaborate with the 

Council members in cases of emergency and other decisions that may need swift implemention. The final step 

is when the governce is in full operation and DOT holders can vote on an upgrade to remove the Web3 Foundation's

sudo key. From this point in the future of the network is 100% in the hands of those who use it, how it should

be. This was a very short and simple summary for a long, complex processes that has been rolling out over the 

course of years and will continue to!

# Network Security

When it comes to blockchain and cryptocurrencies network security is the number one concern. At the end of the day, 

it doesn't matter how useful a blockchain is if the protocol is easily exploitable. I mentioned earlier that Polkadot

is a layer 1 platform along with other protocols such as Ethereum, Cardano and you can even throw in Solana. However,

Polkadot is a self-proclaimed layer 0 protocol. What does this mean? The relay chain is the true polkadot protocol and the 

other chains *connect* to the protocol rather than being built on it. How does this affect the security aspect of the protocol

one might ask? Well, by connecting to the relay chain every parachain or parathread(parachain that has mulitple smaller blockchain taking 

up the slot) is entitled to (instant) shared security through the relay chain. This is the reason that parachain winners must lock

away their bidded Dot, and in exchange they receive not only an amazing platform but security too! This is very different from other

layer 1 protocols such as Ethereum where a weaker application may be singled out and targeted.

# I came here for the competetion!

I have a personal belief that true competetion will bring out the best in everyone. It forces everyone to continously improve

or get left behind. It makes the customer the true boss as everyone is competeting for the better solution! Much like the 

beginning of the internet, there are many blockchain companies who all do the same thing but only the best will become

household names in the future. Polkadot and its layer 1 peers are no different. As of right now, it would appear as if 

Ethereum and Cardano are the main competetitors of Polkadot. Ethereum, the proto-type for the modern blockchain was one 

of a kind and state of the art when it first came out. However, first doesn't always mean the best. Ethereum has run into

some serious issues involving scalabilty(along with some security exploitations). For this reason, Ethereum has become 

almost unusuable for everyday people due to the enormous gas fees from all of the transactions competing to be validated.

Cardano on the other hand, has the same advantage as Polkadot. It was founded by one of the other original members of

Ethereum and from its inception was designed to fix the problems encountered while building Ethereum. In my opinion,

Cardano is a much more formidable competetitor but it tends to focus on use cases for those who the world has failed.

Giving them the opportunity to have a digital identy and access to financial products although it does serve many

of the same purposes as Polkadot no doubt. Taking all of the above points into consideration Polkadot has no 

competetion. Not because its head and shoulder above its competetiors(which I firmly believe), but because it can

connect to its competitors using *bridges*. How can someone be your competition if you can complement each other,

am I right?
