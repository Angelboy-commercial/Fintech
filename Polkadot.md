## What is *Polkadot*?
Polkadot is one of the pioneer blockchains of the new web 3.0. Polkadot is one of a core handful of what

are called Layer 1 blockchains. This means that the protocol serves as a foundation for other protocols 

to build on top of it. Polkadot was founded by Gavin Woods, who is also one of the co-founders of ethereum.

Gavin at the head, Robert Habermeier and Peter Czaban are also co-founders. Polkadot was created in 2016 

and launched a first round Initial Coin Offering(ICO) that raised 140 million dollars in 2017. The reason

for Polkadot being created was difference in opinion within leaders of Ethereum over how to solve the

trilemma that plagues crypto. The blockchain trilemma is the term used to describe the issue 

involving scalabilty, decentralization and security. By focusing on any of the two creates big weaknesses

in the last. The way Gavin Wood and Polkadot chose to solve this was by creating a protocol 'relay' chain.

Polkadot is what is referred to as a heterogenous protocol, meaning different blockchains and connect to 

the relay chain and share security and consensus. Polkadot will have 100 parachains

(blockchains that connect to relay chian) who all compete for the slots in auctions. During these auctions
