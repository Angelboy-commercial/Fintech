## What is *Polkadot*?
Polkadot is one of the pioneer blockchains of the new web 3.0. Polkadot is one of a core handful of what

are called Layer 1 blockchains. This means that the protocol serves as a foundation for other protocols 

to build on top of it. Polkadot was founded by Gavin Woods, who is also one of the co-founders of ethereum.
